## Software packages

### tumor clonal inference
* [cardelino](https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cardelino) - [R]
  * Bayesian clustering of cells to infer clonal tree. 
* [SBMClone](https://github.com/raphael-group/SBMClone) - [python]
  * clustering of cells that share groups of SNVs. Utilizes a stochastic block model to overcoem sparsity.
  
  
### tumor phylogenetic inference

* [CellPhy]()
* [DENDRO]() - [R]
* [ETE3]() - 
* SPhyR
* SiFit
* [SCARLET]
  * k-Dollo implementation to allow LOH under the finite sites hypothesis. Constructs joint phylogenetic tree from CNA and SNV data.

### prospective lineage tracing with synthetic reporters

### phylogenetic approaches

* [GAPML](https://github.com/matsengrp/gapml) - [pythoon]
  * Builds subtrees based on Camin-Sokol parsimony and iterates pruning and ingraftment to assemble highest likelihood tree.
